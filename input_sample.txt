  I love to read books and I am a huge bookworm. I am always excited to try a new book and look for suggestions from family and friends on what I should read next. Users are rarely given recommendations for free books by commercial book recommender systems (Amazon, Google books, etc â€¦) as it is not profitable for them to make such suggestions. On the other hand free book projects such as gutenberg.org have very basic interfaces for users to interact with and get recommendations. There is a large corpus of copyright-free books, that is available for free to readers today and my project would like to make use of these free resources and provide free book suggestions to users. My key motivation behind this project is to create a book recommendation system that works by taking an excerpt of a book that I like in order to give suggestion of a similar book that is freely available.
